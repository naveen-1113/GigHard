CAN'T BELIEVE 
by Dante Varnado Moore

Verse 1
the first time I laid my eyes upon your face
U were the 1 4 me
I never thought that I would find you babe
U R A Dream of Dreams

Pre Chorus
I wanna tell you girl - how U feel 2 me
let me show U baby - just what U mean 2 me
you're the air I breath, you make my life complete
with no U there'd be no me, I just can't believe

Chorus
I cant believe that you're standing here with me
its not a dream but sweet reality
I thought I knew what love was all about
then came U, U turned me (inside) out

I can't believe that I found the one 2b
its as if life has just begun 4me
So many times I'd given up on love
girl with U, it's all I'm dreamin of

Verse 2
Life is so wonderful and beautiful, 
when you R holding me
Love's 2 weak 2 describe what I feel inside
so good I can't believe 

Pre Chorus
I wanna tell you girl - how U feel 2 me
let me show U baby - just what U mean 2 me
you're the air I breath, you make my life complete
with no U there'd be no me, I just can't believe

Chorus
I cant believe that you're standing here with me
its not a dream but sweet reality
I thought I knew what love was all about
then came U, U turned me (inside) out

I can't believe that I found the one 2b
its as if life has just begun 4me
So many times I'd given up on love
girl with U, it's all I'm dreamin of

DON'T TREAT HER WRONG 
by Dante Varnado Moore

Verse 1
you better get her before she's gone
a woman like her rarely comes along

don't u forget her and what shes done
stood at your side, made your house a home

you act like you don't have a clue
a man would give everything to be in your shoes

she's still in love with you, I don't know why
not a day goes by, without a tear in her eyes

Pre Chorus
behind every successful man 
there's an extraordinary  woman

you won't know what u got, till she's gone
u were nothing till she came along
don't treat your woman wrong

Chorus
Dont treat, don't treat yo woman wrong
Respect, respect her as your own
Dont cheat, don't violate your throne
Dont treat, dont treat your woman wrong

Verse 2
sometimes I wonder what's on your mind
a woman like her is so hard to find

don't u forget that she been by you side
thru thick-n-thin - her love 4u, u can't deny

without her your house wont stand
you might as well have built it on sand

she's still in love with u, I don't know why
not a day goes by without a tear in her eye

Pre Chorus
behind every successful man 
there's an extraordinary  woman

you won't know what u got, till she's gone
u were nothing till she came along
don't treat your woman wrong

Chorus
Dont treat, don't treat yo woman wrong
Respect, respect her as your own
Dont cheat, don't violate your throne
Dont treat, dont treat your woman wrong

Bridge
take a closer look and you'll see
she's everything that a woman should be

raised your kids and made home
stood by you, and made you strong
dont treat your woman wrong
